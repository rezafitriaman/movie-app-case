# movie-app-case
A cinema asks me to create a web application in which information about movies can be easily accessed.

On config.ts on the root app you can change the featuredMovies, firstListMovies, secondListMovies, countListsToServe, backgroundBanner.

To start the project u must do npm i and then do ng serve --open
