# movie-app-case
An fictional cinema asks me to create a web application in which information about movies can be easily accessed.

On config.ts on the root app you can change the value for featuredMovies, firstListMovies, secondListMovies, countListsToServe, backgroundBanner.

To start the project u must do "cd m-beam" and then "npm i" and then do "ng serve --open"
